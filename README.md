# Neural-Style-Transfer-in-PyTorch
A deep learning project that fuses the content of one image with the artistic style of another using Neural Style Transfer. This implementation leverages a pre-trained VGG19 model to extract image features and applies style via loss functions computed directly on PyTorch tensors. PyTorch, VGG19, torchvision, matplotlib, PIL, LBFGS optimizer
